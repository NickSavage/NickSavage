## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I was an accountant in a past life, I work now in Tech in a management capacity. 

I'm currently working on [Zettelgarden](https://github.com/NickSavage/Zettelgarden), a personal information management system that implements the [zettelkasten technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).
